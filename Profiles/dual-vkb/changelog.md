### New GIMP Diagram White Background!
- I completely recreated the Subliminal/Buzzzkiller diagram on a pure white background. Using GIMP, which is free and open source, means that anyone can easily modify the file to their liking. I've organized all the layers into logical folders and sub-folders.
- Updated labels on dual VKB diagram with larger fonts for better readability
- Updated the turret operated color to a darker blue for better readability on the dual-vkb diagram.

### Clean up and user improvements
- Updated action descriptions and added sub-descriptions as needed to Joystick Gremlin file. 
- Exported cheetsheet from Joystick Gremlin to "dual-vkb joystick gremlin cheetsheet.pdf"
### Keybind Updates
- Changed Increase/Decrease speed limiter to use the CTRL-Equal/CTRL-Minus keys which are mapped to increase/decrease the SCM speed by 5% increments. This works much better by "moving" the actual vJoy 1 Z axis.

Added changed the right pinky finger button to act as a mode shift button. This effectively doubles the number of buttons for each joystick from 30 each to 60 each. It also doubles the axis of the thumb sticks. To that end I've added some mode shift functionality into Star Citizen for a few buttons. Shift mode is marked as green on the binding chart. 
- Right pinky (D1-button 5) is now the shift button. 
- The push to talk button (Numpad-Plus) is now Button5(D1) + Right Button2(A2)
- Remote Turret 1, 2, and 3 selections are assigned to Right Button5(D1) + Right Hat C1 (left, up, and right)
- Cruise Control toggle is assigned to Right Button5(D1) + Left Hat A4 left
- Zoom In/Out absolute are assigned to Right Button5(D1) + Left Hat A4 Up/down
