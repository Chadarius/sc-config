# Razor Tartarus v2 Star Citizen Layout
I have carpal tunnel now (thanks covid!). Having the Tartarus to place at a very comfortable location makes those bunker nights so much less painful! 
I've added in the most commonly used keys for my FPS play in Star Citizen and a simple color scheme to help remind me what keys are what.
