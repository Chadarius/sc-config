This is a combined repository of Star Citizen Configuration profile exports, Joystick Gremlin profiles and documentation.

Joysticks can be super expensive. Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joysticks go on sale, on Amazon, for $20 each at least 3-4 times per year. They aren't going to last super long and they aren't the best built devices, but they are the cheapest and they just work. You can experience dual stick (HOSAS - Hands on Stick and Stick) with full 6 degress of movement in Star Citizen for only $40. You can also mix and match other devices along with those sticks as you upgrade. Here are some examples of various configurations I have used. 

See [Controller Profiles](./Controller%20Profiles.md) for profiles for Star Citizen and Joystick Gremlin.

See [Star Citizen Initial Setup](star%20citizen%20initial%20setup.md) for game configuration
